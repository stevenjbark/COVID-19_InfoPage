# COVID-19_InfoPage
Website for COVID-19 Webpage Development

# Description
This site has current data and visualizations for COVID-19 in the continental United State. These data were obtained from USAFacts.org
and processed by Steven J. Bark using Pandas/Python scripts and interactive visualizations were created in Tableau Public. All copyrights 
are reserved and copyright owners are acknowledged at the bottom of the InfoPage.

#Deployment
